# Accelerometer_GPS_App

This is an Android Application that I build for a project in School.
It takes all three axies of the phones Accelerometer and stores the data into an SQLite database on the phone.
It will also take the current GPS coordinates and Phones speed and store them with the Acceleromter data in the database.

This data was used to detect road surface conditions on rural roads in Ireland. We used K-Means Clustering Algorithm after the data was collected to analyze the data.
